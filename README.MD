# Background
The code for an SDN controller application that was used to write my undergrad thesis in computer networks and distributed systems. See readme for links to the paper and the poster it was later turned into and published at ICPE2020.

# Installation
Note: Requires Ryu be installed in environment to run.
```
git clone https://github.com/jvaneg/ryuRestDBA.git
cd ryuRestDBA
pipenv install
```

# Learn DPIDs
To learn the DPIDs of the switches the controller is connected to:
```
pipenv run python ./getDPIDs.py
```

# Run (Pica 8 Testbed)

## Run with test script
### Start ryu rest API
In one terminal, ssh into the controller (Host 4) and start the ryu rest API.

Using alias:
```
ryurest
```
Without alias:
```
ryu-manager --verbose ryu.app.simple_switch_13 ryu.app.ofctl_rest
```

### Run test script
In a second terminal, move into the main ryuRestDBA directory (on your regular PC), and run a test.

Ex:
```
bash ./tests/pica8_dba_egal/dbae_nc_udp.sh
```

Simply wait for the test to finish.

## Run manually
### Start ryu rest API
In one terminal, ssh into the controller (Host 4) and start the ryu rest API.

Using alias:
```
ryurest
```
Without alias:
```
ryu-manager --verbose ryu.app.simple_switch_13 ryu.app.ofctl_rest
```

### Start the controller
In a second terminal, ssh into the controller (Host 4) and start the controller.
```
cd ryuRestDBA
pipenv run python ./controller.py [controller config] [-l [log file]]
```


### Generate traffic
On host 3 terminal - start a server:

UDP:
```
iperf -s -u -p 5503
```
TCP
```
iperf -s -p 5503
```


On host 1/2 terminal - start a client:

UDP:
```
iperf -c 192.168.2.3 -u -b 200M -t 30 -p 5503
```
TCP
```
iperf -c 192.168.2.3 -b 200M -t 30 -p 5503
```


# Run (mininet)
Note: Requires Aaron's custom ovs on mininet (TODO: get install intructions from him).

## Start config in mininet
```
cd ryuRestDBA
sudo mn --custom ./mininet/3switchtest.py --controller=remote --topo testbed
```

## Start Ryu controller/REST API
In another terminal:
```
ryu-manager --verbose ryu.app.simple_switch_13 ryu.app.ofctl_rest
```

## Start controller application
In another terminal:
```
cd ryuRestDBA
sudo pipenv run python ./controller.py [controller config] [-l [log file]]
```
Requires sudo for queue installation and cleanup.

For min guarantee version run:
In another terminal:
```
cd ryuRestDBA
sudo pipenv run python ./controller.py ./mininet_min_guar/mn_min_guar_setup.toml [-l [log file]]
```
Requires sudo for queue installation and cleanup.
## Clean up mininet
```
sudo mn --clean
```

# Host commands (mininet)
xterm into hosts from mininet (may require xquartz to be running on macos):
```
xterm h1 h2 h3
```

## Start iperf server
On host 3 terminal:
```
iperf -s -u -p 5503
```

## Start iperf clients
On host 1 and host 2 terminals:
```
iperf -c 10.0.0.3 -u -b 200M -t 30 -p 5503
```
Note: Do not try to use a demand higher than the network can support or you will drop many packets.

# Plot tool
Note: plotTool depends on orca to output graphs. Install orca with:
```
npm install -g electron@1.8.4 orca
```
To plot the resulting data:
```
pipenv run ./tools/plotTool.py [-h] [-o output_name] [-gt graph_title] [-t graph_type] [-s stats] target_csv
```
